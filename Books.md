- Prelude to Mathematics by W.W. Sawyer
  Was written to give students an overview of modern math concepts beyond algebra. Topics include non-euclidian geometry, linear algebra, projective geometry and group theory. Again, for someone with an understanding of algebra. I enjoyed it and think it's in the spirit of what you're looking for.
- Introduction to Graph Theory by Richard J. Trudeau
- Calculus by Michael Spivak
- Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences 3rd Edition by Mary L. Boas
- The videos of Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) His explanations of mathematics are the only ones I can think of that have given me the same sort of piercing clarity and insight that one gets from reading Feynman on physics https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown
- Mathematics: Its Content, Methods and Meaning by A.D. Aleksandrov, A.N. Kolmogorov, M.A. Lavrent
- Steven Strogatz's books Sync and Infinite Powers.
- Walter Rudin
- Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik's Concrete Mathematics has the same exploratory and informal tone that the Feynman lectures have. It's more about computational math than abstract math.
- What Is Mathematics? An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods‚Äù by Courant and Robbins.
- "Mathematics Can Be Fun" by Yakov Perelman Not really a book that has lectures but it's a great book that covers all popular topics in Mathematics (fun to read). (Link: https://mirtitles.org/2015/12/07/mathematics-can-be-fun-yako...)
